                    React.js, developed and maintained by Facebook, stands as a pivotal library in the realm of web
                    development. It empowers developers to construct dynamic and interactive user interfaces with a
                    declarative and component-based approach. Unlike traditional frameworks, React enables the creation
                    of reusable UI components, each encapsulating its logic and state. This modular design not only
                    enhances code maintainability but also fosters a more scalable and collaborative development
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the core of React's efficiency lies the virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the actual
                    DOM. This allows React to selectively update only the components affected by state changes,
                    minimizing the performance bottlenecks associated with constant DOM manipulation. React's one-way
                    data flow ensures a predictable and efficient rendering process, facilitating the development of
                    complex applications while maintaining a smooth user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you are a seasoned developer or just embarking on your coding journey, React's simplicity
                    and flexibility make it an ideal choice for building modern web applications. Its rich ecosystem,
                    including state management libraries like Redux and tooling like Create React App, further
                    solidifies React's position as a go-to solution for crafting robust and maintainable user
                    interfaces.
                </p>

                        React's Component-Based Architecture: React revolutionizes client-side development by
                        introducing a component-based architecture. Components, encapsulating their own logic and UI,
                        can be easily reused throughout the application. This modular approach enhances code
                        organization, facilitates collaboration among developers, and contributes to the overall
                        maintainability of the project.

                    <li>
                        Virtual DOM Optimization: React's innovative use of a virtual DOM significantly improves the
                        efficiency of rendering in web applications. Instead of directly manipulating the actual DOM,
                        React creates a virtual representation, allowing it to identify and update only the components
                        affected by state changes. This optimization reduces the performance overhead associated with
                        frequent DOM manipulations, resulting in faster and more responsive user interfaces.

                    Ready to embark on your React journey? Let's kick things off with a simple example to get you
                    started. Follow the steps below to create your first React component:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Install React: If you haven't already, make sure to set up a React environment. You can do this
                        by using a tool like Create React App or integrating React into an existing project.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a React Component: In your project, create a new file (e.g., MyComponent.js) and write
                        the following React code:
                        <code>
                    import React from 'react';

                    function MyComponent() {
                      return <div>Hello, I'm a React component!</div>;
                    }
                    
                    export default MyComponent;
                  </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Run Your React App: Save the file and run your React application. If you're using Create React
                        App, you can use the command <code>npm start</code> to launch your app in the development mode.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    That's it! You've just created and rendered your first React component. Feel free to explore and
                    modify this component as you delve deeper into the world of React development.

                <p>
                    React applications are built using components â€“ modular, reusable pieces of code that encapsulate a
                    part of your user interface. Components are the building blocks of a React application, and they can
                    be simple or complex, depending on the functionality they encapsulate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In React, there are two main types of components: functional components and class components.
                    Functional components are stateless and are mainly used for presenting UI, while class components
                    can manage state and have access to lifecycle methods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Components can be composed to create larger, more complex user interfaces. This composability is one
                    of the key strengths of React, allowing developers to build scalable and maintainable applications
                    by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As you delve into React development, understanding how to create, use, and compose components is
                    fundamental. The following sections will guide you through working with both functional and class
                    components, explaining their differences and use cases.

                    <p>
                        Props, short for properties, are a fundamental concept in React that allows you to pass data from a
                        parent
                        component to a child component. They enable the communication between components, allowing you to
                        customize and
                        configure child components based on the needs of the parent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a parent component renders a child component, it can pass data to the child component through
                        props. Props
                        are essentially read-only and should not be modified by the child component. This unidirectional
                        flow of data
                        ensures a clear and predictable data flow within your React application.

                import React from 'react';
          
                // Child component that receives and displays a prop
                const Greeting = (props) => {
                  return (
                    <span>
                      Hello, {props.name}!
                    </span>
                  );
                };
          
                // Parent component that renders the child component with a prop
                const App = () => {
                  return (
                    <span>
                      {/* Render the Greeting component and pass the name prop */}
                      // Greeting name="John Doe" />
                    </span>
                  );
                };

                    Defining and using props is a key aspect of React development. In the upcoming sections, you will
                    learn how to pass
                    props to functional and class components, how to access them within the component, and how to
                    leverage props to
                    create dynamic and reusable components.

            <header>State</header>
            <article>
                <span>
                    In React, state is a crucial concept for creating dynamic and interactive components. The state
                    represents the
                    current condition or data of a component and can be changed over time in response to user actions or
                    other
                    events. When the state of a component is updated, React automatically re-renders the component to
                    reflect the
                    changes.
                </span>

                <span>
                    To use state in a functional component, you can leverage the useState hook provided by React. This
                    hook allows
                    you to declare state variables and provides a function to update them. Let's look at a simple
                    example:
                </span>

                <code>import { useState } from 'react';</code>

                <span>Declare a state variable 'count' with an initial value of 0</span>

                <code>const [count, setCount] = useState(0);</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Lifecycle_Methods">
            <header>Lifecycle Methods</header>
            <article>
                <span>
                    Lifecycle methods in React are special functions that are invoked at different points in the life of
                    a
                    functional component.
                    They provide an opportunity to perform actions at specific phases, such as when a component is
                    created,
                    updated, or destroyed.
                </span>

                <span>
                    One commonly used lifecycle method is <code>useEffect</code> It is called after the component has
                    been
                    rendered to the DOM.
                    This is a good place to perform side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually
                    changing
                    the DOM.
                </span>

                <code>
              import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
          
              const MyComponent = () => {
                useEffect(() => {
                  // Perform side effects, API calls, etc.
                  console.log('Component has been rendered!');
                }, []);
          
                return <div>Hello, I'm a React component!</div>;
              };
          
              export default MyComponent;
            </code>

                <span>
                    Understanding the lifecycle methods is crucial for managing the behavior of your components
                    throughout
                    their existence.

        <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_Rendering">
            <header>Conditional Rendering</header>
            <article>
                <span>
                    Conditional rendering in React allows you to control the display of components based on certain
                    conditions.
                    This is essential for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces where content can change
                    based on
                    user actions or data.
                </span>

                <span>
                    One common pattern for conditional rendering is using the ternary operator within JSX to render
                    different content based on a condition.
                </span>

                <code>
              import React, { useState } from 'react';
          
              const MyComponent = () => {
                const [isLoggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false);
          
                return (
                  <span>
                    {isLoggedIn ? (
                      <span>Welcome, User!</span>
                    ) : (
                      <span>Please log in to continue.</span>
                    )}
                  </span>
                )
              }
          
              export default MyComponent;
            </code>

                <span>
                    In this example, the content displayed depends on the value of the `isLoggedIn` state. If true, it
                    shows
                    a welcome message; otherwise, it asks the user to log in.

            <header>Lists and Keys</header>
            <article>
                <span>
                    In React, lists are used to render multiple elements dynamically. When rendering a list of items,
                    each item should have a unique identifier, known as a "key". Keys help React identify which items
                    have changed, are added, or are removed, improving performance and maintaining component state.
                </span>

                <span>
                    Here's an example of rendering a list of items in React with keys:
                </span>

                <code>
                import React from 'react';
            
                const MyList = () => {
                  const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];
            
                  return (
                    &lt;div&gt;
                      {items.map((item, index) => (
                        &lt;span key={index}&gt;{item}&lt;/span&gt;
                      ))}
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                  );
                };
            
                export default MyList;
              </code>

                    In this example, the `map` function is used to iterate over the array of items, and each item is
                    rendered within a span element with a unique key.

                    React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to use state and other React features
                    that
                    were previously only available in class components. They provide a more direct way to interact with
                    the
                    React state and lifecycle features.

                <span>
                    Another commonly used hook is the `useContext` hook, which allows you to subscribe to React context
                    without introducing nesting. Here's a simple example:
                </span>

                <code>
              import React, { useContext } from 'react';
          
              // Create a context
              const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
          
              // Use the context in a component
              const ThemedComponent = () => {
                const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
          
                return <span>The current theme is {theme}</span>;
              };
          
              // Wrap a part of your application with the context provider
              const App = () => {
                return (
                  <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
                    <ThemedComponent />
                  </ThemeContext.Provider>
                );
              };
          
              export default App;
            </code>

                <span>
                    In this example, the `useContext` hook is used to consume the current theme from a context, allowing
                    components to dynamically adjust based on the theme.

                    Routing is a fundamental aspect of building single-page applications (SPAs) with React. It enables
                    navigation between different views or components without the need for a full-page reload.

                <span>
                    React Router is a widely used library for implementing routing in React applications. Here's a brief
                    example of how you can set up basic routing using React Router:
                </span>
                <code>
                import React from 'react';
                import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
            
              </code>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Context_API">
            <header>Context API</header>
            <article>
                <span>
                    React's Context API allows you to share values, such as state or functions, across your React
                    component
                    tree without the need to pass props through every level of nesting.
                </span>
                <span>
                    In this example, we've created a simple context named "MyContext" using createContext. We then have
                    a
                    provider component, MyContextProvider, which wraps around the part of the component tree where we
                    want to
                    share the context.
                </span>
                <span>
                    The value provided by the context can be accessed in any child component using the useContext hook.
                    For instance, we've consumed the context value in this component, and you can see the message:
                    "Hello from Context!".
